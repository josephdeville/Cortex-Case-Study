## Implications for Case Study

### What This Tells Us About Their GTM Challenges

1. **Lean team getting leaner** - 78 employees down 21% YoY means they need efficiency
2. **Two RevOps Directors** - Possible organizational complexity or recent restructuring
3. **Hiring GTM Engineer** - They know they need operational leverage
4. **Already using Clay** - Validates my project direction
5. **Heavy Marketo/SFDC investment** - Integration expertise matters
6. **Competing against well-funded players** - Need differentiation in GTM, not just product

### What They Probably Want to Hear

1. **Efficiency mindset** - Do more with less
2. **Quick wins** - Prove value fast with a leaner team
3. **Systems thinking** - Build scalable infrastructure, not one-off campaigns
4. **Technical credibility** - Can actually build in Clay, Marketo, SFDC
5. **AI/automation forward** - Leverage tools to multiply effort
6. **Cross-functional** - Work seamlessly with the small Marketing/Sales teams

### Red Flags to Avoid

1. Don't propose solutions requiring big new tool investments
2. Don't suggest hiring more people to solve problems
3. Don't ignore their existing Clay/Marketo/SFDC stack
4. Don't propose slow-moving, multi-quarter initiatives only
